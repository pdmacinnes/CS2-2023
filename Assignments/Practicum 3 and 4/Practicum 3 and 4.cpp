/*
CSCI 112 Data Structures
Practicum   Demo Due in class on Friday next week



Derive the class extClockType from the class clockType (below) by adding a member variable to store the time zone.

Add the necessary member functions and constructors to make the class functional.

Also, write the definitions of the member functions and the constructors.

Derive the class alarmClockType the class ClockType by adding the necessary member functions and constructors to make the class functional.

The alarm should identify the trigger time AM from PM.
    
Finally, write a test program to test your derived classes.
